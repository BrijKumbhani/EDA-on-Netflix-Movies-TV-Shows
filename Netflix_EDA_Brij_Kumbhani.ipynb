        "The project titled “Exploratory Data Analysis on Netflix Movies and TV Shows” aims to uncover meaningful insights from Netflix's catalog of entertainment content by analyzing and visualizing key attributes such as content type, genre, release year, duration, country of origin, and audience ratings. This project was undertaken as part of the Business Analyst internship at Labmentix with a focus on building strong analytical reasoning, storytelling through data, and generating business-relevant insights.\n",
        "\n",
        "Netflix, being a global leader in streaming services, provides a diverse range of movies and TV shows catering to different age groups, countries, and genres. The dataset used in this project comprises 7,787 rows and 12 columns, offering details about the content title, director, cast, country, rating, duration, genres (listed_in), and more. This data served as a valuable resource to understand how Netflix curates its platform, which countries dominate the content list, and what type of content has been favored over the years.\n",
        "\n",
        "The project followed a structured Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) approach, beginning with understanding the structure of the dataset, identifying missing values, and performing data wrangling such as converting date columns to datetime formats, separating duration into numeric and categorical fields, and filling missing values logically. After preprocessing, visual and statistical analysis was conducted to uncover patterns and trends.\n",
        "\n",
        "Key analyses include:\n",
        "\n",
        "Distribution of Movies vs TV Shows\n",
        "\n",
        "Frequency of content added over time\n",
        "\n",
        "Top contributing countries to the Netflix catalog\n",
        "\n",
        "Commonly assigned maturity ratings\n",
        "\n",
        "Dominant genres in the platform\n",
        "\n",
        "Duration analysis for both movies and shows\n",
        "\n",
        "Trends in content addition over years\n",
        "\n",
        "Various tools and libraries like pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn were utilized for data manipulation and visualization. The project also included generating clean and interpretable charts, such as bar plots, count plots, boxplots, and heatmaps, to support findings. In addition, text-based insights using word clouds and genre decomposition were considered to understand viewer trends and platform direction.\n",
        "\n",
        "The findings provide strong support for Netflix's strategy of global content delivery with a heavy skew towards Movies. The majority of content originates from the United States and India, with a clear preference for mature-rated content (e.g., TV-MA, R). Content addition saw a steep rise post-2016, likely correlating with the company's aggressive expansion into original content and regional markets.\n",
        "\n",
        "In conclusion, this project not only enhanced hands-on EDA skills but also developed the ability to derive business recommendations from data trends. As a Business Analyst, learning how to convert raw data into actionable strategies is crucial. This project demonstrates that skill by identifying content gaps, regional concentration, and audience preferences. These insights could be used by Netflix (or similar platforms) to diversify their content portfolio, optimize recommendations, and improve regional engagement.\n",
        "\n",
        "This EDA serves as a foundational analysis that could be extended into predictive modeling, user segmentation, or clustering to identify potential user behaviors or content success trends. The experience gained here is directly applicable to real-world business analytics challenges."
